# Board (M4 design)

The physical board: stackup, outline, rules, footprint placement, copper (tracks, vias, zones), keep-outs and
graphics. Stored in `board.json`; zone fills are derived data cached under `.cadlab/`.

## Conventions

- Coordinates in `Nm`, Y up, origin at the lower-left of the outline's bounding box by default (any origin is
  valid; outputs translate as their format requires).
- Layer names follow the widespread convention: copper `F.Cu`, `In1.Cu` … `In30.Cu`, `B.Cu`; technical
  `F.SilkS`/`B.SilkS`, `F.Mask`/`B.Mask`, `F.Paste`/`B.Paste`, `F.Fab`/`B.Fab`, `F.CrtYd`/`B.CrtYd`,
  `Edge.Cuts`. These are names only (`crate::board::Layer`), no code is shared with any tool (D7).
- A footprint on the bottom side is mirrored across the Y axis (x → −x) before rotation, and all its layers swap
  F ↔ B.
- Every board item (track, via, zone, keep-out, graphic) has an `ObjectId`; commands address them as
  `track#12`, `via#40`, `zone:GND_bottom`.

## Model (`src/model/board.rs`)

```
Board
├── stackup       copper layer count and names, finished thickness, copper weights, dielectric (optional),
│                 board spec preferences (finish, mask/silk colors) — requirements, not a fab choice (D12)
├── outline       closed contours of line/arc segments: the first is the outer edge, others are cutouts
├── rules         design rules (engineering intent): clearance, track width, via drill/diameter, min annular
│                 ring, min drill, hole-to-hole, copper-to-edge, silk-to-pad, zone min width; net classes override
│                 per net (from the circuit)
├── footprints    by refdes: position, rotation, side, locked; footprint name defaults to the part's
├── tracks        segments (and arcs): layer, width, net, start, end, optional arc midpoint
├── vias          position, drill, diameter, net, layer span (through by default)
├── zones         polygon, layer(s), net, priority, clearance, min width, thermal relief settings
├── keepouts      polygon, layers, what is forbidden (tracks, vias, pours, footprints)
└── graphics      silkscreen/fab/user drawings and texts
```

## Shared geometry (`src/board/`)

One module turns the board into geometry that every consumer uses, so DRC, rendering, Gerber output and the
router agree on what copper exists:

- `pads(board, project)`: every placed pad with its absolute shape (polyclip polygon), layers, net, drill.
- `copper(board, project, layer)`: pads, tracks (stadium shapes), vias, zone fills on a layer, each with its net.
- `ratsnest(board, project)`: unrouted connections per net (minimum spanning tree over pads, minus what copper
  already connects), from the circuit's nets.
- `connectivity(board, project)`: copper islands and which nets they join (shorts) or split (opens).

## Commands

| Group | Commands |
|---|---|
| `board` | `setup` (layers, thickness, preferences), `outline` (rect, polygon, circle, rounded rect), `rules`, `info`, `ratsnest`, `sync` (add footprints for new components, drop removed ones) |
| `place` | `set` (at, rotation, side), `move` (relative), `rotate`, `flip`, `lock`, `list`, `auto` (initial grid by schematic groups), `near` (place a part next to another's pin) |
| `track` | `add` (polyline through points on a layer, width from net class/rules), `remove`, `list` |
| `via` | `add`, `remove` |
| `zone` | `add`, `remove`, `fill` (M4 zone workstream) |
| `drc` | `run` (M4 DRC workstream) |
| `render` | `board` (layers, realistic) (M4 rendering workstream) |
| `export` | `gerber`, `drill`, `pnp`, `ipc356`, `fab` (M4 outputs and fab workstreams) |

## Workstreams after the model lands

DRC, zone fill, board rendering, fab outputs (Gerber X2/X3, Excellon, IPC-D-356A, pick-and-place), fab profiles
(JLCPCB, PCBWay) with `fab check/compare/export`, and `.kicad_pcb` export with the KiCad DRC oracle are
independent of each other once the model and shared geometry exist, and are built in parallel.
