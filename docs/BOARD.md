# Board (M4 design)

The physical board: stackup, outline, rules, footprint placement, copper (tracks, vias, zones), keep-outs and
graphics. Stored in `board.json`; zone fills are derived data cached under `.cadlab/`.

## Conventions

- Coordinates in `Nm`, Y up, origin at the lower-left of the outline's bounding box by default (any origin is
  valid; outputs translate as their format requires).
- Layer names follow the widespread convention: copper `F.Cu`, `In1.Cu` … `In30.Cu`, `B.Cu`; technical
  `F.SilkS`/`B.SilkS`, `F.Mask`/`B.Mask`, `F.Paste`/`B.Paste`, `F.Fab`/`B.Fab`, `F.CrtYd`/`B.CrtYd`,
  `Edge.Cuts`. These are names only (`crate::board::Layer`), no code is shared with any tool (D7).
- A footprint on the bottom side is mirrored across the Y axis (x → −x) before rotation, and all its layers swap
  F ↔ B.
- Every board item (track, via, zone, keep-out, graphic) has an `ObjectId`; commands address them as
  `track#12`, `via#40`, `zone:GND_bottom`.

## Model (`src/model/board.rs`)

```
Board
├── stackup       copper layer count and names, finished thickness, copper weights, dielectric (optional),
│                 board spec preferences (finish, mask/silk colors) — requirements, not a fab choice (D12)
├── outline       closed contours of line/arc segments: the first is the outer edge, others are cutouts
├── rules         design rules (engineering intent): clearance, track width, via drill/diameter, min annular
│                 ring, min drill, hole-to-hole, copper-to-edge, silk-to-pad, zone min width; net classes override
│                 per net (from the circuit)
├── footprints    by refdes: position, rotation, side, locked; footprint name defaults to the part's
├── tracks        segments (and arcs): layer, width, net, start, end, optional arc midpoint
├── vias          position, drill, diameter, net, layer span (through by default)
├── zones         polygon, layer(s), net, priority, clearance, min width, thermal relief settings
├── keepouts      polygon, layers, what is forbidden (tracks, vias, pours, footprints)
└── graphics      silkscreen/fab/user drawings and texts
```

## Shared geometry (`src/board/`)

One module turns the board into geometry that every consumer uses, so DRC, rendering, Gerber output and the
router agree on what copper exists:

- `pads(board, project)`: every placed pad with its absolute shape (polyclip polygon), layers, net, drill.
- `copper(board, project, layer)`: pads, tracks (stadium shapes), vias, zone fills on a layer, each with its net.
- `ratsnest(board, project)`: unrouted connections per net (minimum spanning tree over pads, minus what copper
  already connects), from the circuit's nets.
- `connectivity(board, project)`: copper islands and which nets they join (shorts) or split (opens).

## Commands

| Group | Commands |
|---|---|
| `board` | `setup` (layers, thickness, preferences), `outline` (rect, polygon, circle, rounded rect), `rules`, `info`, `ratsnest`, `sync` (add footprints for new components, drop removed ones) |
| `place` | `set` (at, rotation, side), `move` (relative), `rotate`, `flip`, `lock`, `list`, `auto` (initial grid by schematic groups), `near` (place a part next to another's pin) |
| `track` | `add` (polyline through points on a layer, width from net class/rules), `remove`, `list` |
| `via` | `add`, `remove` |
| `zone` | `add`, `remove`, `fill` (M4 zone workstream) |
| `drc` | `run` (M4 DRC workstream) |
| `render` | `board` (layers, realistic) (M4 rendering workstream) |
| `export` | `gerber`, `drill`, `pnp`, `ipc356`, `fab` (M4 outputs and fab workstreams) |

## DRC (`src/drc.rs`, `drc.run`)

`drc::check(project)` returns diagnostics sorted by code, then location; `drc.run` reports them (the CLI exits 3
on errors). Each has the objects involved (pins `U1.3`, `track#12`, `via#4`, `net:GND`, designators), a board
location and a fix hint. Clearance and track width come from the net's class when it sets them, else from
`board.rules`. Distances are exact between the shared polygon shapes; since arcs are approximated outward by up
to 1 µm, distance rules accept a 2 µm deficit.

| Code | Severity | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `drc.no_outline` | error | the board has no outline (edge rules are skipped) |
| `drc.unplaced`, `drc.no_footprint` | warning | component not placed / placed without a footprint |
| `drc.short` | error | copper of different nets touches on a shared layer (also no-net copper touching a net) |
| `drc.clearance` | error | copper of different nets (or no net vs a net) closer than the larger of the two clearances; pads of one footprint are not checked against each other |
| `drc.track_width` / `drc.track_width_class` | error / warning | track narrower than `min_track_width` / than its net class width |
| `drc.via_drill`, `drc.pad_drill` | error | via or pad hole below `min_drill` |
| `drc.via_annular_ring`, `drc.pad_annular_ring` | error | (pad size − drill) / 2 below `min_annular_ring` (vias, plated pads) |
| `drc.hole_to_hole` | error | holes (vias, plated and non-plated pads) closer than `hole_to_hole`, edge to edge |
| `drc.outside_board` | error | copper not inside the outer contour, or overlapping a cutout |
| `drc.copper_to_edge` | error | copper closer than `copper_to_edge` to any contour |
| `drc.courtyard_overlap` | error | courtyards of two footprints on the same side overlap (touching is fine) |
| `drc.footprint_outside` | error | courtyard partly outside the board or over a cutout |
| `drc.silk_over_pad` | warning | footprint or board silkscreen closer than `silk_to_pad` to a pad on that side |
| `drc.keepout` | error | track, via or footprint courtyard inside a keep-out that forbids it (on its layers) |
| `drc.unrouted` | error | a ratsnest connection, with both ends |

Candidate pairs come from a uniform grid over bounding boxes (no extra dependency), so a board with a few
thousand items checks in well under a second in release builds (3000 tracks + 200 vias: about 75 ms).

## Workstreams after the model lands

DRC, zone fill, board rendering, fab outputs (Gerber X2/X3, Excellon, IPC-D-356A, pick-and-place), fab profiles
(JLCPCB, PCBWay) with `fab check/compare/export`, and `.kicad_pcb` export with the KiCad DRC oracle are
independent of each other once the model and shared geometry exist, and are built in parallel.
